    "## Hierarchical Bayesian modeling for languange distribution \n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical Bayesian modeling is an appropriate choice in order for us to retrieve a 'risk' score as we are  looking to understand language distributions across different levels (e.g., projects, repositories) and want to incorporate uncertainty into our estimates. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows us to model the data at multiple levels, capturing both the variability within individual repositories and the commonalities across projects. It can help identify if a language's usage is unusually high or low by comparing it to the overall distribution, thereby flagging potential concerns. "

    "To start building a hierarchical Bayesian model using PyMC3 based on your JSON data, you'll first need to parse the data to extract the relevant information for modeling. This involves aggregating language usage across repositories and projects. After that, we define a hierarchical model that captures the variability within repositories and commonalities across projects.\n",
