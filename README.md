# EA-metrics

## Introduction

EA-metrics is a repository dedicated to demonstrating how Enterprise Architecture (EA) can be driven by data to make informed decisions and understand the complex IT ecosystem within organizations. By leveraging real-time metrics, EA groups can transition from traditional, often qualitative, decision-making processes to a more quantitative, evidence-based approach.

## Goal

The primary goal of EA-metrics is to provide a framework and examples for measuring and interpreting key metrics that impact the efficiency, agility, and effectiveness of IT infrastructures and architectural decisions within an enterprise.

## Metrics Overview

The repository is structured around key Enterprise Architecture metrics, each housed in its subfolder. These metrics include, but are not limited to:

- IT Project Success Rate
- Alignment with Business Strategy
- Application Portfolio Health
- IT Cost Efficiency
- IT Agility
- and many more...

Each metric subfolder contains a detailed explanation of the metric, how to measure it, and example scripts or tools to gather and analyze the relevant data.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the metric of interest and review the `README.md` in the subfolder for specific instructions.
3. Utilize the provided scripts or tools to collect and analyze data relevant to your organization's EA initiatives.
